# Professional Statement

I am an aspiring cybersecurity professional with strong analytical thinking and a practical problem-solving mindset. I am building my foundation through cybersecurity training (including Foundations of Cybersecurity) and a Level 5 IT qualification with studies in Business Analysis and Generative AI, as I transition into the IT industry.

I am passionate about protecting systems, data, and people from security threats, and I value integrity, responsibility, and working within laws, policies, and ethical standards. As I continue learning, I aim to help organizations identify risks, follow security controls, and maintain secure and reliable operations in an entry-level or junior cybersecurity role.
